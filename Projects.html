			<p>I'm currently finishing my CS50 projects. However, following this, I want to act on an old brain connection that claims that idly passing time will make me happy. Dopamine is then running through that connection, which is what is motivating me to act in that way. This will be my final CS50 project, so stay tuned for that!</p>

			<p>After completing my final project, I intend to create an AI second brain that will house everything the user has learned from all sources and be accessible on-screen. As a result, whenever the user is consuming content, this extension will appear, highlighting anything I've previously learned that is pertinent and letting them connect the dots between the various pieces of information. The user's ability to connect data will be improved, and they won't have to worry about memorising all the information. This simulates how ideas appear whenever we notice patterns, assisting users in the field of idea production.</p>
