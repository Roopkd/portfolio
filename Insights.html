		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>1. </span>I did/do have fear of long codes, maybe because i try everything at once, thus confusing myself and hence not being able to solve. So I tried to divide whole projects in small problems and solve them individually and concaenate later all of them. This work for me, but i would like to take many more projects so that i would forget this fear. Another thing is ignore those thoughts and dont try to recall them and only focus on work, this is helpful and try mindfulness as training for this.</p>
		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>2. </span>Always check like check50, as by accounting every situation there can be. This will enable to find more better just by seeing whole code and scenario for which we are building.</p>
		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>3. </span>Don't hop on ChatGPT for solution, first think of solution as that is where our development will happen, after thinking of solution then refer chatgpt or any other source and compare with your solution, this way we will get more knowledge of ways to complete the solution which is beneficial for us.</p>
		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>4. </span>While problem solving always ask correct question, this way i would be able to solve the problem, rather than brute forcing solution just like in the case of old and new code of readability.c, by asking what is word as i need to count words in that string, i was able to observe that a word starts with a alphabet and ends with any other thing, thus enable me to have a good solution.
also here i would like to mention that i should expand my knowledge and observe things, which will create new connections, and will help me to for idea generation also.</p>
		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>5. </span>First, read prompt or question page well two to three times and write requirements in a page, as otherwise if i miss somethings the check50 will give X or timeout, i shouldn't go ask help if check50 isn't doing what i wanted it to do first find mistake in my solution and after not being to solve then seek help</p>
		<p><span style='background: #FFE338; color: #000000;'>6. </span>Before code, gather knowledge about functions, etc as there may a function which would complete task rather than building function from scratch, this doesn't mean not to think of such function logic, just encouraging to learn other logic or algo to brush up and expand knowledge so do both before hard coding it.</p>
